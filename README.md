    ## Description

    As a user, I want to be able to enter in information for  a number of employees with set information based on their role. I need one manager, and a number of engineers and interns. Using this application, I am able to follow a series of prompts within the command terminal, and generate an html page displaying all of my employees with their information.

    ## Tests

    By running npm run test in the command terminal. There are test files for each of the employee types to ensure that code has been written effectively. There are also controls for user errors, such as trying to run the "Generate Team" function without having entered any employees, failing to enter any information into a given prompt, and trying to submit more than one manager.
